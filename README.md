React App For our Coffee Palace 

JSX  : The javascripct code rendered by the object.

Q : Why not use Vanilla Javascript?
A : 
  - Server side rendering was complicated. Then JQwery came and rise of single page client side rendering (Single Page App or SPA) took place.
  - This was then moved towards the Web Development at the client side.
  - There are several problems with using client side single page app using Vanilla JS.
  - Requires a lot of direct DOM manipulation and Traversing - Spagetti Code
  - Data is usually stored in DOM, shared across the entire app
  -  HTML was the owner and JS was used inside a script tag. That is now reversed.

    
Q : Why do FE framework exists?
A : 
   - Keeping a UI in sync with Data is really hard and a lot of work.
   - Correct way of structuring and writing code
   - Consistent way of building FE Applications

Q : States vs Props.
A : 
  - States are command state variables inside the class.
  - Props are the parameters passed to other JSX Objects.
