Q : Why not use Vanilla Javascript?
A : Server side rendering was complicated. Then JQwery came and rise of single page client side rendering (Single Page App or SPA) took place.
    - This was then moved towards the Web Development at the client side.
    - There are several problems with using client side single page app using Vanilla JS.
    - Requires a lot of direct DOM manipulation and Traversing - Spagetti Code
    - Data is usually stored in DOM, shared across the entire app
